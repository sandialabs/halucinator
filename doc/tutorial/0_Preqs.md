# Preqs

This tutorial assumes you have HALucinator installed on Ubuntu 18.04 and in a
virtual environment named `halucinator`, and that the source is located in your
home directory (e.g. ~/).  See main repo README for instructions on setting up.

It also uses Ghidra 9.1.2 which we have located in ~/ghidra_9.1.2.  It
can be located anywhere but you'll have to adjust paths. It can be obtained
from https://ghidra-sre.org/.

We also use visual studio code through the tutorial.  You can use this or your
preferred editor.
